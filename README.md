## About
A custom icon for iTerm (or any terminal application, for that matter). Draws influences from the [original iTerm icon](http://www.iterm2.com/images/logo.png), but more closely resembles Yosemiteâ€™s own Terminal.app icon. 

The <code>icns</code> file includes optimised icons for 512, 256, 128, and 32-pixel, including 2x sizes for Retina displays.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository's master branch to your computer.
2. In a new Finder window, navigate to your `/Applications` directory, click on iTerm, and type `ctrl-i` (or right-click and choose Get Info).
4. Drag the `.icns` file overtop of the iTerm icon in the Info panel. You will see the icon change. Close the Info panel.
5. Right-click on your iTerm application and choose Show Package Contents.
6. Navigate to `/Contents/Resources`, and copy the `.icns` file to this directory (choose Replace when Finder asks).
7. You're done! Open iTerm to see the icon update.
