## About
A custom icon for any terminal application. Draws influences from Yosemiteâ€™s own Terminal.app icon, but uses Solarized colours and a `$_` instead of a `>_` for the prompt. 

The <code>icns</code> file includes optimised icons for 512, 256, 128, and 32-pixel, including 2x sizes for Retina displays.

## Installation

4. Drag the `.icns` file overtop of the iTerm icon in the Info panel. You will see the icon change. Close the Info panel.
5. Right-click on your iTerm application and choose Show Package Contents.
6. Navigate to `/Contents/Resources`, and copy the `.icns` file to this directory (choose Replace when Finder asks).
